            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>By His Majeſties Command.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IMmediatly after the Defeat of the Rebels at <hi>Bridge-water;</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the ſixth of <hi>July</hi> inſtant, the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> late Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> fled; and coming between <hi>Gillingham</hi> and <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> got a Guide to lead them the way to the New Forreſt, moſt free from Towns and Watches; he led them by <hi>White-Sheet</hi> four Miles Eaſt of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and thence by <hi>Cranborne</hi> Chaſe; where their Horſes being tir'd, they let them looſe, and hid their Bridles and Sadles.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the News of the ſaid Defeat coming to the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> then poſted at <hi>Ringwood</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> with three Troops of Horſe of Collonel <hi>Staplyes</hi> Regiment, commanded by Major <hi>Bridger,</hi> Captain <hi>Monk</hi> and Captain <hi>Peckham,</hi> and four Companies of Foot of Collonel <hi>Alfords</hi> Regiment, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Cooper,</hi> Captain <hi>Bickely,</hi> Captain <hi>Beſt,</hi> and Captain <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> all of the <hi>Suſsex</hi> Militia: His Lordſhip was pleaſ'd to ſend his Scouts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way to take up ſuſpected Perſons; and Sir <hi>William Portman,</hi> for the ſame end, had taken care for ſtrong Watches to be ſet, made up of his yellow Coats and others, on the Roads from <hi>Pool</hi> to the moſt Northern parts of <hi>Dorſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the ſeventh Inſtant, about five in the Morning, ſome of the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi>'s ſaid Scouts (riding in the Road near <hi>Holt Lodge</hi> in <hi>Dorſet,</hi> four Miles Weſt of <hi>Ringwood</hi>) juſt at the turn of a Croſs way, ſurpriz'd and ſeiz'd two ſuſpected Perſons; which (when the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> came up) prov'd to be the late Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and the ſaid Guide: This put the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> upon a ſtrict examining of the Cottages (with which that Heathy Country abounds) and call'd in the Neighbourhood that were acquainted with the Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Notice of this being brought to Sir <hi>William Portman,</hi> by ſome of his Watches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He haſten'd to the Place with as many Horſe and Foot as he could of a ſudden get together.</p>
            <p>It happen'd upon the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi>'s inquiry amongſt the Cottages, that a poor Woman, one <hi>Amy Farrant</hi> directed his Lordſhip to a Hedge, where ſhe had ſeen two men go over; which Hedge prov'd to be part of the Out-bounds of very many encloſed Grounds; ſome overgrown by Fearn and Brakes, and others ſown with Rye, Peaſe, or Oats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon a ſtrict Guard was put very near one another, round thoſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds; whilſt other Foot and Horſe did beat within: Theſe Guards kept their ſeveral Poſts ſo well, that tho the late Duke, and the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> attempted at leaſt thirty times, to make their Eſcape out, yet they always found each Guard ready; and upon their laſt attempt to eſcape, two of the Troopers fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, made them immediatly to Retire and hide themſelves apart from each other, in ſome of the adjacent Ditches, where they were afterwards found.</p>
            <p>

Upon the eight day by five of the Clock in the morning, the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> was found; who upon Examination, confeſs'd, that he parted with the ſaid late Duke within the ſame Out-bounds, about one of the Clock that morning: Whereupon every individual Perſon being encourag'd thereby, and by the hopes of having a ſhare in the 5000. <hi>l.</hi> (as was before agreed of in the Field) did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the purſuit of him with the ſtricteſt ſearch and diligence imaginable; and about ſeven of the clock of the ſame morning, one <hi>Henry Parkin</hi> (ſervant to <hi>Samuel Rolles</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>) happened to diſcover the ſaid late Duke hid in a Ditch, covered with Fearn and Brakes, and calling to two of the <hi>Suſsex</hi> Troopers that were by him, all three ſeiz'd him together: Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> happening to be near that place, rid preſently in and quieted thoſe that cried Shoot him, Shoot him! he laid hands on him as his Priſoner, and ſo preſerv'd him from all violence and rudeneſs: And immediately in the ſame inſtant, the Lord <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> came in, and agreed that Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> ſhould ſearch him; which was done, and as ſoon as they had found his <hi>George,</hi> they diſpatched that, with the News to his Majeſty by Captain <hi>Bickely,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chaldecot,</hi> a <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners after this were keept two nights at <hi>Ringwood.</hi> On <hi>Friday</hi> the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> diſcharged the Foot there; and with the ſaid three Troops of the <hi>Suſſex</hi> Horſe, and one Troop of the <hi>Dorſet</hi> Militia, commanded by Captain <hi>Fownes,</hi> they were conveyed to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Where joyn'd them two Troops of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties in pay, and two of the <hi>Northampton</hi> Militia Troops, all which condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them to <hi>Farnham</hi> Caſtle upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 11th. and the next day to <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 13th. to <hi>Fox-hall,</hi> where a Regiment of the Lord <hi>Dartmouths</hi> received them, with other Troops of His Majeſties in pay, and thence by Barge they were carried to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Papers and Books that were found on him are ſince delivered to His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>One of the Books was a Manuſcript of Spells, Charms, and Conjurations, Songs, Receits, and Prayers, all written with the ſaid late Duke's own hand.</p>
            <p>Two others were Manuſcripts of Fortification and the Military Art.</p>
            <p>And a fourth Book fairly written, wherein are Computes of the yearly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of His Majeſties Navy and Land Forces.</p>
            <p>And as for his Gold; only twenty Guinies were given to the ſaid <hi>Parkin;</hi> and ten Guinies a piece to the two Troopers, that firſt ſeiz'd him; and the reſt was return'd to the ſaid late Duke.</p>
            <p>As the Priſoners paſſed through <hi>Rumſey, Winchester, Farnham,</hi> and <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> one would admire to ſee the very great numbers of the Militia, with the Deputy Lieutenants, and Gentlemen of thoſe parts, that were ready to guard them, and take off the Fatigue of ſuch as were on the March.</p>
            <p>Within doors none but Commiſſion Officers were truſted to watch by them; and beſides thoſe, the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> and Sir <hi>William Portman</hi> took their turns to watch in Perſon, night and day, from the time of the taking of the ſaid late Duke, until they had delivered him ſafe at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> from whence he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
